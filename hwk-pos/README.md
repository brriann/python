to run demo:
1. create virtualenv
2. python setup.py install
3. python main.py

you need to use numpad for inputs. the "network" indicator will be red since it's running on localhost.
try changing to your computer's local IP.

I've also disabled GoogleDrive. but you can set "__debug" in .hwk/config.json to True and run it if you like.

doesn't work on windows
